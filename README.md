# ❤️ Likes to Go

**Your music taste in a file**

A Chrome extension that saves your SoundCloud likes as a file. No accounts, no servers, no audio downloaded. Your data, to go.

## 🎵 What it does

You have hundreds (or thousands) of liked tracks on SoundCloud. This extension lets you save them as a clean JSON file -- a personal backup of your music library.

- Open your SoundCloud likes page
- Hit the button
- Get a file with every track: title, artist, URL, duration, genre, tags, artwork, and more

That's it. Your likes, your file, your hard drive.

## 📄 Output format

	"format_version": 1,
	"exported_at": "2026-02-18T12:00:00Z",
	"source_url": "https://soundcloud.com/you/likes",
